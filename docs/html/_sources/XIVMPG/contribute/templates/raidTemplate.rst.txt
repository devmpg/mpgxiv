Waymark import
==============

This section can be used to create copyable text box of a waymark preset to be imported through Dalamund

.. warning::
    A bunch of shitty players have been crying about people clearing content they don't even qualify to see the cutscene for while using preloaded waymarks. So SE was forced to respond in true SE fashion:

    `You can read their response here <https://i.imgur.com/bNpOXyx.png>`_

    In Summary:
        * SE acknowledges that they made a shit waymark system
        * SE then blames players for circumventing it
        * SE demands you delete the way markers now
        * But SE also acknowledges that theyâ€™re good waymarks and they'll make it so you can manually remake the same exact markers.
        * But not yet. For now just delete your good waymarks and then we will let you remake them exactly the same sometime later, maybe.  Idiot.
        * No one has been punished for using the waymarks (except that one idiot, but he deserved it the most)
        * No one will be banned for using the markers (unless they arbitrary decide otherwise)

    **At the end of the day the odds of you getting caught using 3rd party addons are slim to none unless you do something stupid.  But as always use at your own risk.**
